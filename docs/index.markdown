## Quick Start

```
git clone git@github.com:kathleenfrench/pls.git
cd pls
make install
```

### Configs

When you run `pls` for the first time, you will be prompted to set config values `pls` requires to be of much use to you.

If at any point you want to update your configuration values, simply run: `pls update configs`.

You can view which configs are currently set by running `pls show configs`.
